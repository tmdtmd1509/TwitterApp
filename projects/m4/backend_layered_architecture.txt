Back-end layered architecture

basic architecture:
Client - Amazon API GateWay - lambda function - dynamoDB


Amazon API GateWay:
I have a 6 resources. Feed(get), followees(get, put), followers(get, put), hashtags(get), status(post), story(get,
/{alias}(get))
They get called by client and they trigger the each Amazon lambda function.


Amazon Lambda Function:
This get called by API methods.

I have a 4 different Lambda function that triggered by API Gateway.
1. get_story
	This function only get the story of the alias's
2. get
	This does different thing by event's path.
	feed: get alias's all the followers and followees and their statuses
	followers: get alias's followers
	followees: get alias's followees
	hashtags: get all the statuses that has a certain hashtag
3. put
	This update the dynamoDB by request of API calls
	This does different thing by event's path.
	followees: update followees of alias's
	followers: update followers of alias's
	user: update user's followers and followees
4. post
	This function only post a new status by alias

If function needs to access to database and get the information, it get, post or update dynomaDB's table items.
After function get data from database, each lambda function response with 200, 404, 502 and asked datas.

DynamoDB:
I have 5 tables.
feed, followees, followers, picture, and status.
