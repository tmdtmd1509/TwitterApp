Explanation of how you isolated the client/server communication details.
	I made the new folder called src/api. In api folder, I have actions.js, apiContext.js, apiCreateContext.js
and apiReducer.js. I used Redux system to isolated the client/server communication. I do all the server side action calls at the api folder.
apiContext.js has every function calls. It sends the request and get the response from the server.
Client only needs to import apiContext.js file and use use specific function in the apiContext.js to communicate with server.
After it receives the response, it will update the response to global state. Client only need to check if the state gets changed or not.
If it got changed it means request got the response.
